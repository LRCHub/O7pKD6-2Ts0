# Two Friends、MOD SUN – Timebomb

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
life has been taken for granted
too long
the lies and excuses have
conquered
a blind man can notice the
system is crippled
dreams are a long lost desire
and now its just a time bomb
waiting to go off
so tell me why has it come to
this?
we live just like we're dead
afraid of something, afraid of
someone
It's time to rise rise rise from
the ashes
rise rise rise it's a new day
life has been taken for granted
too long
the lies and excuses have
conquered
If all that is left is the flesh
on our bodies
how can we call our selves human
its just a time bomb waiting to
go off
It might be seconds now
the world's a time bomb waiting
to go off
so tell me why has it come to
this?
we live just like we're dead
afraid of something afraid of
someone
It's time to rise rise rise from
our coffins now
don't you say your done
believing there is hope
the clock is ticking but we're
still breathing
It's time to rise rise rise from
the ashes
rise rise rise it's a new day
Its time to face all of our
mistakes, Its time to recreate
Its time to stand up and walk
again
screaming we're not dead
so tell me why has it come to
this?
we live just like we're dead
afraid of something afraid of
someone
It's time to rise rise rise from
our coffins now
don't you say your done
believing there is hope
the clock is ticking but we're
still breathing
It's time to rise rise rise from
the ashes
rise rise rise it's a new day
rise rise rise till your last
breath

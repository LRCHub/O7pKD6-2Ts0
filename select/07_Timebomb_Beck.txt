We got a timebomb
We got a timebomb
We got a timebomb
Na na na na
We got a warning light
We got a warning light
We pull the plug out and we
Na na na na
Timebomb ticking
Timebomb ticking
It's a timebomb ticking
Tick tick tick tick
Timebomb ticking
Timebomb ticking
It's a timebomb ticking
Going
We got a timebomb
We got a timebomb
We got a timebomb
Na na na na
We got a red alert
We got a red alert
We cut the power and we
Na na na na
It's a timebomb ticking
Timebomb ticking
It's a timebomb ticking
Going tick tick tick tick
It's a timebomb ticking
Timebomb ticking
It's a timebomb ticking
Going tick tick tick tick
We're going sideways
Highways
Riding on an elevator
Cold just like an alligator
Now my baby's out of date
Fighting and lightning
And tightening above the buckles
Of an atom bomb's timebomb
Tick tick tick tick
Bah bah ba
We got a timebomb
We got a timebomb
We got a timebomb
Na na na na
We got a red alert
We got a red alert
We pull the plug out and we
Na na na na
We got a cigarette
We got a cigarette
We got a cigarette
Na na na na
Timebomb ticking
Timebomb ticking
It's a timebomb ticking
Going
Bah bah ba

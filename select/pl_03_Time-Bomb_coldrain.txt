When I got here I knew this was
hard to hold
Like a clash the whole thing
spun out of control
Oh, on wire, we were dancing
Two kids no consequences
Pull a trigger, without thinking
There's only one way down this
road
It  like a time bomb, set it
in motion
We were only destined to explode
And if I have to pull you out of
the wreckage
You know I'm never gonna let you
go
Oh, like a time bomb
Gotta use it, let's defuse it
Ticking like a time bomb
But I need it
Wouldn't have it any other way
Well there's no way out of this
So let's stay in
Have a storm that comes,
I'll soak us to the bone
Oh resistance is useless
Just two kids stupid and
fearless
Like a motor, shooting a lesson
There's only one way down this
road
It was like a time bomb, set it
in motion
We were only destined to explode
And if I have to pull you out of
the wreckage
You know I'm never gonna let you
go
Oh, like a time bomb
Gotta use it, let's defuse it
Ticking like a time bomb
But I need it
Wouldn't have it any other way
Got your heart in my hands, like
a time bomb ticking
It goes off, we start again
If it breaks, we fix it
Got my heart in your hands, like
a time bomb ticking
We should know
That I love you, won't let go
It was like a time bomb, set it
in motion
We were only destined to explode
And if I have to pull you out of
the wreckage
You know I'm never gonna let you
go
Like a time bomb
Gotta use it, let's defuse it
Ticking like a time bomb
But I need it
Wouldn't have it any other way

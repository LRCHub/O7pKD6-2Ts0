Listen Waiting It's past one
o'clock and I'm out of time
Can't undo the lock and no key
to ﬁnd Looking all around at
the station Are we frozen?
Failing To understand how I can
hear your mind Racing on and on
through the years of time Future
is their home and I need to Get
back to mine
Listen, I've done this often
I've never had an issue with
this machine in motion The
clocks in the walls are numb And
I've been waiting here for so
long, so long Listen, I've got a
problem And you're the only one
who knows this room has a
function Stay eighty years ahead
And live this life without you
instead
